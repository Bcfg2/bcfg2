Import existing ssh keys
========================

.. note::

    In order for the instructions in this guide to work, you will need
    to first setup the :ref:`reporting system <reports-dynamic>` so that
    the server has the information needed to create the existing
    entries.

This guide details the process for importing existing ssh keys into your
server repository.

Add a bundle for ssh
====================

After verifying that SSHbase is listed on the plugins line in
``/etc/bcfg2.conf``, you need to create a bundle containing the
appropriate entries.  In general, you can use a path glob:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Bundle>
      <Path glob="/etc/ssh/*"/>
    </Bundle>

If you need more granular control -- e.g., other entries in
``/etc/ssh`` are specified in other bundles -- you can also list the
files explicity:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Bundle>
      <Path name='/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key'/>
      <Path name='/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key'/>
      <Path name='/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub'/>
      <Path name='/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub'/>
      <Path name='/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key'/>
      <Path name='/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub'/>
      <Path name='/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts'/>
    </Bundle>

Next, you need to add the ssh bundle to the client's metadata in
groups.xml.

Validate your repository
========================

Validation can be performed using the following command::

    bcfg2-lint

Run the bcfg2 client
====================

::

    bcfg2 -vqn

You will see the incorrect entries for the ssh files::

    Phase: initial
    Correct entries:        0
    Incorrect entries:      7
    Total managed entries:  7
    Unmanaged entries:      649

    In dryrun mode: suppressing entry installation for:
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key      Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub  Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key          Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub

    Phase: final
    Correct entries:        0
    Incorrect entries:      7
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key      Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub  Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key          Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub
    Total managed entries:  7
    Unmanaged entries:      649

Install the client's ssh keys into the Bcfg2 repository
=======================================================

Now, we pull the ssh host key data for the client out of the uploaded
stats and insert it as host-specific copies of these files in
``/var/lib/bcfg2/SSHBase``.::

    for key in ssh_host_rsa_key ssh_host_dsa_key ssh_host_key; do
        sudo bcfg2-admin pull <clientname> Path /etc/ssh/$key
        sudo bcfg2-admin pull <clientname> Path /etc/ssh/$key.pub
    done

This for loop pulls data that was collected by the bcfg2 client out of
the statistics file and installs it into the repository. This means that
the client will keep the same ssh keys and the bcfg2 server can start
generating a correct ssh_known_hosts file for the client.

Run the bcfg2 client (again)
============================

::

    bcfg2 -vqn

This time, we will only see 1 incorrect entry.::

    Phase: initial
    Correct entries:        6
    Incorrect entries:      1
    Total managed entries:  7
    Unmanaged entries:      649

    In dryrun mode: suppressing entry installation for:
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

    Phase: final
    Correct entries:        6
    Incorrect entries:      1
     Path:/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
    Total managed entries:  7
    Unmanaged entries:      649

Now, the only wrong entry is the ssh_known_hosts file, so go ahead
and install it::

    bcfg2 -vqI

After answering 'y' to the interactive prompt, the client will install
the known_hosts file successfully.
