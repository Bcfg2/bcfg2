Troubleshooting
===============

From time to time, Bcfg2 produces results that the user finds surprising.
This can happen either due to bugs or user error. This page describes
several techniques to gain visibility into the bcfg2 client and server
and understand what is going on.


Figure out if error is client or server side
============================================

* Cache a copy of the client configuration using ``bcfg2 -qnc /tmp/config.xml``
* Look in the file and search for the entry of interest
* If it looks correct, then there is a client issue
* If not, it is time to inspect things on the server

This file contains all aspects of client configuration. It is structured
as a series of bundles and base entries.

.. note::

    Most often the entry is not correct and the issue lies in
    the specification.

Review server log messages
==========================

The bcfg2-server process logs to syslog facility LOG_DAEMON. The server
produces a series of messages upon a variety of events and errors.

Check if all repository XML files conform to schemas
====================================================

Bcfg2 comes with XML schemas describing all of the XML formats used in
the server repository. A validation command ``bcfg2-lint`` is
included with the source distribution and all packages.

If the bcfg2 server is not reflecting recent changes, try restarting the bcfg2-server process
=============================================================================================

If this fixes the problem, it is either a bug in the
underlying file monitoring system (fam or gamin) or a bug in
Bcfg2's file monitoring code. In either case, file a `ticket
<https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2/newticket>`_ in the tracking
system. In the ticket, include:

* filesystem monitoring system (fam or gamin)
* kernel version (if on linux)
* if any messages of the form "Handled N events in M
  seconds" appeared between the modification event and the client
  configuration generation request appeared in the server log
* which plugin handled the file in the repostiory (Cfg, Rules, Packages,
  TCheetah, TGenshi, Metadata)
* if a touch of the file after the modification causes the problem to
  go away

bcfg2-info
==========

Bcfg2 server operations can be simulated using the ``bcfg2-info`` command.
The command is interactive, and has commands to allow several useful
operations

* clients - Current client metadata (profile and group) settings
* groups - Current group metadata values
* mappings - Configuration entries provided by plugins
* buildfile <filename> <hostname> - Build a config file for a client
* showentries <client> <type> - Build the abstract configuration (list
  of entries) for a client
* build <hostname> <output-file> - Build the complete configuration
  for a client

Type `help` in bcfg2-info for more information.

.. [1] This entry is not being bound. Ensure that a version of this
       entry applies to this client.
.. [2] It is possible that the type attribute for this generator entry
       is undefined. You may need to add the appropriate type attribute
       in the literal entry specification.
.. [3] Copy the Bcfg2 server's CA certificate to the client and specify it
       using the **ca** option in the [communication] section of
       ``bcfg2.conf``
.. [4] If the group doesn't exist, you need to specify the correct one
       in an :ref:`info.xml <server-info>` file or set the default group
       appropriately.
.. [5] If the owner doesn't exist, you need to specify the correct one
       in an :ref:`info.xml <server-info>` file or set the default owner
       appropriately.
.. [6] This entry is not being bound. Ensure that a version of this
       entry applies to this client.
.. [7] Ensure that another instance of the daemon (or any other process)
       is not listening on the same port.
.. [8] Ensure that the key is readable by the user running the daemon
       and that it is well-formed.
.. [9] Ensure that this file still exists; a frequent cause is the
       deletion of a temp file.
.. [10] Ensure that the file is properly formed XML.
.. [11] Fix hostname resolution for the client or ensure that the profile
        group is properly setup.
.. [12] Ensure the correct encoding is specified in the [components]
        section of ``bcfg2.conf``.
.. [13] For packages listed other than **gpg-pubkey**, this error means
        that the Packages plugin is unable to find the package in any of
        the sources listed in ``Packages/config.xml``. The issue often
        arises when the client is not in one of the groups necessary for
        the Source listed. In the case of gpg-pubkey, you can safely
        ignore the message as the Packages plugin has no knowledge of
        these packages (however, note that this package is most often
        specified as a BoundPackage entry).
.. [14] Ensure that you have installed all the necessary
        :ref:`installation-prerequisites`.
.. [15] You likely need to specify a base64 encoding using an
        :ref:`server-info` file for this entry.

FAQs
====

Why won't bcfg2-server start?
-----------------------------

If your server doesn't seem to be starting and you see no error
messages in your server logs, try running it in the foreground to see
why.

Why am I getting a traceback?
-----------------------------

If you get a traceback, please let us know by reporting it
on `Trac ticket tracker`_, via the mailing list, or on IRC. Your best bet
to get a quick response will be to jump on IRC during the daytime (CST).

.. _Trac ticket tracker: http://bcfg2.org

What is the most common cause of "The following entries are not handled by any tool"?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often it corresponds to entries that aren't bound by the server (for which
you'll get error messages on the server). You should try inspecting the
logs on the server to see what may be the cause.
