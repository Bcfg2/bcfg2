1.3.6
=====

We are happy to announce the release of Bcfg2 1.3.6. It is available for
download at:

 ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg

This is primarily a bugfix release.

* Fix python 2.4 compatibility
* Fix stale lockfile detection and behavior
* Reporting: fix filter urls
* Fix client protocol option handling
* YUM: Add options to enable and disable Yum plugins
* Packages: add name to sources
* Reporting: better exception handling
* Various interrupt handling fixes
* Fix client decision whitelist/blacklist handling
* Fix database OPTIONS parsing
  
  This change requires you to set the *options* value of the
  ``[database]`` section in ``bcfg2.conf`` to the literal value which is
  passed through to the django OPTIONS setting.
