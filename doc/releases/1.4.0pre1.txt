1.4.0pre1
=========

The first prerelease for Bcfg2 1.4.0 is now available at:

 ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg

Bcfg2 1.4.0pre1 is a prerelease, and contains many new features,
including some that are backwards-incompatible with Bcfg2 1.3.x and
earlier. Please read the release notes thoroughly. This is a prerelease
and as such is not likely suitable for general production deployment.
That said, please help us test the release in non- and preproduction
environments.

backwards-incompatible user-facing changes
------------------------------------------

* Completely rewrote option parser

  Many single character options now have long equivalents.  Some
  subcommand interfaces (``bcfg2-info``, ``bcfg2-admin``) have been
  reorganized to some degree. ``bcfg2-reports`` syntax is completely
  different.

* Added new :ref:`server-plugins-misc-acl` plugin

  Default ACLs only allow clients to perform bcfg2 client runs, and only
  permit `bcfg2-admin xcmd` calls from localhost.  If you want to change
  this, you must enable the ACL plugin and configure your own ACLs.

* Added genshi requirement for the server

* :ref:`server-plugins-generators-decisions`

  * Switch plugin to use StructFile instead of host- or group-specific XML
    files (this allows a single e.g. whitelist.xml file with <Group> tags)

    You can convert your existing decisions using
    ``tools/upgrade/1.4/migrate_decisions.py``.

* The Probe plugin no longer strips probe output. You may need to adjust
  your probe output if you want trailing whitespace to be removed.


deprecated features (will be removed in a future release, likely 1.5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* :ref:`server-plugins-structures-bundler`

  * Deprecated use of an explicit name attribute

    You can convert your existing bundles using
    ``tools/upgrade/1.4/convert_bundles.py``.

  * Deprecated :ref:`.genshi bundles
    <server-plugins-structures-bundler-index-genshi-templates>` (use
    .xml bundles and specify the genshi namespace instead)

* SSLCA

  * Deprecated plugin
  * SSLCA functionality has been added to the Cfg plugin:
    see :ref:`server-plugins-generators-cfg-ssl-certificates`
