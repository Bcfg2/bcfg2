1.4.0pre2
=========

The second prerelease for Bcfg2 1.4.0 is now available at:

 ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg

Bcfg2 1.4.0pre2 is a prerelease, and contains many new features,
including some that are backwards-incompatible with Bcfg2 1.3.x and
earlier. Please read the release notes thoroughly. This is a prerelease
and as such is not likely suitable for general production deployment.
That said, please help us test the release in non- and preproduction
environments.

* NagiosGen: Add bundles to configuration

backwards-incompatible user-facing changes
------------------------------------------

* Changed default communication protocol to xmlrpc/tlsv1

* Diff output from files sent to the Reports plugin from the client will now be
  in a unified diff format rather than the previous n-diff format.

  This fixes potentially long client runs when comparing files that have
  diverged significantly.

Thanks

Special thanks to the following contributors for this release

 * Alexander Sulfrain
 * Matt Kemp
 * Jeremie Banier
