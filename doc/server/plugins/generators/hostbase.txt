Hostbase
========

IP management system built on top of Bcfg2. It has four main parts: a
django data model, a web frontend, command-line utilities, and a Bcfg2
plugin that generates dhcp, dns, and yp configuration files.

Installation
============

Installation of Hostbase requires installation of a python module,
configuration of database (mysql or postgres), and configuration of an
Apache webserver with mod_python. Hostbase was developed using MySQL,
so this document is aimed at MySQL users.

Prerequisites
-------------

* `mysql`_
* `python-mysqldb`_
* `Django`_

.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com
.. _python-mysqldb: http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html
.. _mysql: http://www.mysql.com/

Configure the database
----------------------

Create the hostbase database and a user.  For MySQL users::

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE hostbase
    mysql> quit

    systemprompt#:  mysql -u root hostbase
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO hostbaseuser@mycomputer.private.net IDENTIFIED
           BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    mysql> quit

As of Bcfg2 v0.8.7 configuration options for Hostbase have moved to
``/etc/bcfg2.conf``.  There is an example bcfg2.conf with Hostbase
options located at ``bcfg2-tarball/examples/bcfg2.confHostbase``.
Edit the hostbase options to correspond to the database you've
initialized and copy the configuration to ``/etc/bcfg2.conf``.  To
finish creating the database, from your ``path to
python/Bcfg2/Server/Hostbase`` directory, run ``python manage.py
syncdb`` to do all table creation.

Configure the web interface
---------------------------

Now it's possible to explore the Hostbase web interface.  For
curiosity, you can run Django's built-in development server to take a
peek.  Do this by running ``python manage.py runserver
[servername:port]`` from your Hostbase directory.  Django will
default to ``localhost:8000`` if no server or port is entered.  Now
you can explore the web interface.  Try adding a host and a zone.
You'll see that a ".rev" zone already exists.  This is where
information for reverse files will go.

For production, you'll want to have this configured for Apache with
mod_python. Here is an example of how to configure Hostbase as a
virtual host.

.. code-block:: html

    <VirtualHost hostbase.mcs.anl.gov:80>
            ServerAdmin systems@mcs.anl.gov

            DocumentRoot /var/www/hostbase/
            <Directory />
                    AllowOverride None
            </Directory>

            # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
            # alert, emerg.
            LogLevel warn

            ServerSignature Off

            # Stop TRACE/TRACK vulnerability
            <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
                    RewriteEngine on
                    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
                    RewriteRule .* - [F]
            </IfModule>

            Redirect / https://hostbase.mcs.anl.gov/
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost hostbase.mcs.anl.gov:443>
            ServerAdmin systems@mcs.anl.gov

            DocumentRoot /var/www/hostbase/
            <Directory />
                    AllowOverride None
            </Directory>

            # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
            # alert, emerg.
            LogLevel warn

            ServerSignature Off

            # Stop TRACE/TRACK vulnerability
            <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
                    RewriteEngine on
                    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
                    RewriteRule .* - [F]
            </IfModule>

            SSLEngine On
            SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/hostbase_server.crt
            SSLCertificateKeyfile /etc/apache2/ssl/hostbase_server.key

    <Location "/">
            SetHandler python-program
            PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
            SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE Bcfg2.Server.Hostbase.settings
            PythonDebug On
    </Location>
    <Location "/site_media/">
            SetHandler None
    </Location>
    </VirtualHost>


You'll need to copy the contents of ``Hostbase/media`` into
``/var/www/hostbase/site_media`` in this configuration to serve the
correct css files.

Enable the Hostbase plugin
--------------------------

Now that the database is accessible and there is some data in it, you can
enable the Hostbase plugin on your bcfg2 server to start generating some
configuration files.  All that needs to be done is to add ``Hostbase``
to the end of the list of generators in your bcfg2.conf file.  To see
what's being generated by Hostbase, fire up a bcfg2 development server:
``bcfg2-info``.  For more information on how to use the bcfg2 development
server, type help at the prompt.  For our purposes, type ``debug``.
This will bring you to an interactive python prompt where you can access
bcfg's core data.

.. code-block:: python

    for each in bcore.plugins['Hostbase'].filedata:
        print each


The above loop will print out the name of each file that was generated
by Hostbase.  You can see the contents of any of these by typing ``print
bcore.plugins['Hostbase'].filedata[filename]``.

Create a bundle
---------------

Bcfg2 needs a way to distribute the files generated by Hostbase.
We'll do this with a bundle.  In bcfg's ``Bundler`` directory, touch
``hostbase.xml``.

.. code-block:: xml

    <Bundle name='hostbase' version='0.1'>
       <Package name='dhcp3-server'/>
       <Package name='bind9'/>
       <Service name='dhcp3-server'/>
       <Service name='bind9'/>
       <Path name='/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf'/>
       <Path name='/etc/bind/[your domain]'/>
       <Path name='/etc/bind/xxx.xxx.xxx.rev'/>
    </Bundle>

The above example is a bundle that will deliver both dhcp and dns files.
This can be trivially split into separate bundles.  It is planned that
Hostbase will eventually be able to generate the list of ``Paths``
in its bundles automatically.

Do a Hostbase push
------------------

You'll want to be able to trigger the Hostbase plugin to rebuild
it's config files and push them out when data has been modified
in the database.  This can be done through and XMLRPC function
available from the Bcfg2 server.  From a client that is configured
to receive one or more hostbase bundles, you'll need to first
edit your ``python/site-packages/Bcfg2/Client/Proxy.py`` file.
Add ``'Hostbase.rebuildState'`` to the list of methods in the bcfg2
client proxy object.  The modified list is shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    class bcfg2(ComponentProxy):
        '''bcfg2 client code'''
        name = 'bcfg2'
        methods = ['AssertProfile', 'GetConfig', 'GetProbes', 'RecvProbeData', 'RecvStats', 'Hostbase.rebuildState']

Now copy the file ``hostbasepush.py`` from ``bcfg2/tools`` in the bcfg2
source to your machine.  When this command is run as root, it triggers
the Hostbase to rebuild it's files, then runs the bcfg2 client on your
local machine to grab the new configs.

NIS Authentication
==================

Django allows for custom authentication backends to its login procedure.
Hostbase has an NIS authentication backend that verifies a user to be
in the unix group allowed to modify Hostbase.

To enable this feature:

* first edit your ``Hostbase/settings.py`` file and uncomment
  the line **Hostbase.backends.NISBackend** in the list of
  *AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS*
* enter the name of the unix group you want to give access to Hostbase
  in the *AUTHORIZED_GROUP* variable
* in your ``Hostbase/hostbase/views.py`` file at the very bottom,
  uncomment the block(s) of lines that give you the desired level
  of access

Hostbase will now direct the user to a login page if he or she is not
authorized to view a certain page.  Users should log in with their
regular Unix username and password.
