SSHbase
=======

SSHbase is a purpose-built Bcfg2 plugin for managing ssh host keys. It
is responsible for making ssh keys persist beyond a client rebuild and
building a proper ``ssh_known_hosts file``, including a correct localhost
record for the current system.

It has two functions:

* Generating new ssh keys -- When a client requests a dsa, rsa, or v1 key,
  and there is no existing key in the repository, one is generated.

* Maintaining the ``ssh_known_hosts`` file -- all current known public
  keys (and extra public key stores) are integrated into a single
  ``ssh_known_hosts`` file, and a localhost record for the current client
  is added. The ``ssh_known_hosts`` file data is updated whenever any
  keys change, are added, or deleted.

Interacting with SSHbase
========================

* Pre-seeding with existing keys -- Currently existing keys will be
  overwritten by new, sshbase-managed ones by default. Pre-existing keys
  can be added to the repository by putting them in <repo>/SSHbase/<key
  filename>.H_<hostname>

* Pre-seeding can also be performed using bcfg2-admin pull ConfigFile
  /name/of/ssh/key

* Revoking existing keys -- deleting <repo>/SSHbase/\*.H_<hostname>
  will remove keys for an existing client.

Aliases
=======

SSHbase has support for Aliases listed in clients.xml. The address for
the entries are specified either through DNS (e.g. a CNAME), or via the
address attribute to the Alias.

Getting started
===============

#. Add SSHbase to the **plugins** line in ``/etc/bcfg2.conf`` and
   restart the server -- This enables the SSHbase plugin on the Bcfg2
   server.

#. Add Path entries for ``/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts``, and
   ``/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key``, etc to a bundle or base.

#. Enjoy.

At this point, SSHbase will generate new keys for any client without
a recorded key in the repository, and will generate an
``ssh_known_hosts`` file appropriately.

Adding public keys for unmanaged hosts
======================================

If you have some hosts which are not managed by Bcfg2, but you would
still like to have their public ssh keys available in
``ssh_known_hosts``, you can add their public keys to the ``SSHbase``
directory with a *.static* ending.

Example:

``a.static``::

    TEST1

``b.static``::

    TEST2

The generated ``ssh_known_hosts`` file::

    TEST1
    TEST2
