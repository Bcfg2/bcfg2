ACL
===

The ACL plugin lets you set client communication ACLs to prevent
clients from accessing the full range of exposed XML-RPC methods.

You can get a list of all exposed methods by running::

    bcfg2-admin xcmd listMethods

Note that this will only list methods that are available to the client
this is run from; that is, if the ACL plugin is in place,
``listMethods`` will reflect the ACLs.

ACLs can be set in two different ways:

* IP-based ACLs allow you to set ACLs based on client IP address or
  CIDR range.
* Metadata-based ACLs allow you to set ACLs based on client hostname,
  group membership, or complex combinations thereof.

IP-based ACLs are much faster, but metadata-based ACLs are often
easier and better.

If you are not going to use any ACLs, it is recommended that you
disable this plugin because using it can incur a slight performance
hit.  If you are using IP-based ACLs but *not* metadata-based ACLs, it
is similarly recommended that you ensure that your IP-based ACL file
ends with an explicit Deny for all clients; this will ensure that
metadata-based ACLs are never checked.  If you are using
metadata-based ACLs, :ref:`server-caching` can alleviate most of the
performance penalty.

Enabling the ACL plugin
=======================

First, create ``/var/lib/bcfg2/ACL/``.  Then, add ``ACL`` to your
``plugins`` list in ``bcfg2.conf``::

    plugins = Bundler, Cfg, ..., Packages, ACL

Finally, create ``/var/lib/bcfg2/ACL/ip.xml`` (for `IP-based ACLs`_),
``/var/lib/bcfg2/ACL/metadata.xml`` (for `Metadata-based ACLs`_), or
both.

IP-based ACLs
=============

IP-based ACLs allow you to set ACLs based on client IP address or CIDR
range.  IP-based ACLs are very fast.  If you are using IP-based ACLs
but *not* metadata-based ACLs, it is recommended that you ensure that
your IP-based ACL file ends with an explicit Deny for all clients;
this will ensure that metadata-based ACLs are never checked.

IP-based ACLs are defined in ``ACL/ip.xml``.  The file is parsed
sequentially; the first matching rule applies.  Each rule is either
Allow (to allow the client access), Deny (to deny the client access),
or Defer (to defer to `Metadata-based ACLs`_).  The last rule in
``ip.xml`` is an implicit default allow for 127.0.0.1, and an implicit
default defer for all other machines.

If no ``ip.xml`` file exists, then ACL checking will be deferred to
metadata-based ACLs.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: xml

    <ACL>
      <Allow address="192.168.1.10" method="*.*"/>
      <Deny address="192.168.2.0" netmask="255.255.255.0"
            method="AssertProfile"/>
      <Allow address="192.168.1.12" method="Git.Update"/>
      <Allow method="*"/>
    </ACL>

In this example:

* The machine at 192.168.1.10 (perhaps the Bcfg2 server) can call all
  plugin XML-RPC methods;
* Machines in the 192.168.2.0/24 network cannot assert their own
  profiles;
* The machine at 192.168.1.12 (perhaps the Git server) can call the
  Git.Update method;
* All machines can call core methods (except 192.168.2.0/24, which can
  call all core methods except AssertProfile).

Implicitly, all machines (except localhost) except 192.168.1.10 are
disallowed access to the plugin methods.

You can also provide a minimal configuration to try to weed out some
obvious bad requests before doing the more expensive `Metadata-based
ACLs`_.  For instance:

.. code-block:: xml

    <ACL>
      <Allow method="*"/>
      <Defer address="192.168.1.0" netmask="24" method="*.*"/>
      <Deny method="*.*"/>
    </ACL>

In this example:

* All machines can call all core methods without checking metadata
  ACLs;
* Plugin method calls from machines in 192.168.1.0/24 are deferred to
  metadata ACLs; and
* All other plugin method calls are denied.

The only time metadata ACLs would be checked in this example would be
plugin method calls by machines in 192.168.1.0/24.

Metadata-based ACLs
===================

Metadata-based ACLs let you set ACLs based on client hostname or group
membership, which is much more flexible and maintainable than
`IP-based ACLs`_.  The downside is that it is slower, because it
requires generating client metadata for each machine that tries to
authenticate.  Without :ref:`server-caching`, using metadata-based
ACLs will double the number of client metadata builds per client run,
which could be a sizeable performance penalty.

In order to limit the performance penalty, it's highly recommended
to:

* Enable :ref:`server-caching` in ``cautious`` or ``aggressive`` mode;
  and
* Deny as many clients as possible with `IP-based ACLs`_.

Metadata-based ACLs are defined in ``ACL/metadata.xml``.  Only Allow
and Deny rules are supported, not Defer rules.  The file is parsed
sequentially; the first matching rule applies.  The last rule in
``metadata.xml`` is an implicit default allow for machines called
``localhost`` or ``localhost.localdomain``, and an implicit default
deny for all other machines.

If no ``metadata.xml`` file exists, then all requests are implicitly
allowed.

Example
-------

This example is functionally identical to the `IP-based ACLs` example
above, but more maintainable in several ways:

.. code-block:: xml

    <ACL>
      <Group name="bcfg2-server">
        <Allow method="*.*"/>
      </Group>
      <Group name="user-workstations">
        <Deny method="AssertProfile"/>
      </Group>
      <Group name="git-server">
        <Allow method="Git.Update"/>
      </Group>
      <Allow method="*"/>
    </ACL>

In this case, if you add a Bcfg2 server or Git server, or one of those
servers changes IP address, you don't need to rewrite your ACLs.
Similarly, you could add a new subnet of user workstations.

.. _server-plugins-misc-acl-wildcards:

Wildcards
=========

The ACL descriptions allow you to use '*' as a wildcard for any number
of characters *other than* ``.``.  That is:

* ``*`` would match ``DeclareVersion`` and ``GetProbes``, but would
  *not* match ``Git.Update``.
* ``*.*`` would match ``Git.Update``, but not ``DeclareVersion`` or
  ``GetProbes``.

Since all plugin methods are scoped to their plugin (i.e., they are
all ``<plugin name>.<method name>``), and all core methods have no
scope, this lets you easily allow or deny core or plugin methods.  You
could also do something like ``*.toggle_debug`` to allow a host to
enable or disable debugging for all plugins.

No other bash globbing is supported.
