Probes

At times you need to gather information from a client machine before you
can generate its configuration. For example, if some of your machines
have both a local scratch disk and a system disk while others only have
the system disk, you would want to know this information to correctly
generate an `/etc/auto.master` autofs config file for each type. Here
we will look at how to do this.

First you will need to set up the TCheetah plugin, as described on the
:ref:`server-plugins-generators-tcheetah` page.

Next, we need to create a ``Probes`` directory in our toplevel repository
location::

    mkdir /var/lib/bcfg2/Probes

This directory will hold any small scripts we want to use to grab
information from client machines.  These scripts can be in any scripting
language; the shebang line (the ``#!/usr/bin/env some_interpreter_binary``
line at the very top of the script) is used to determine the script's
interpreter.

.. note::

    Bcfg2 uses python mkstemp to create the Probe scripts on the
    client. If your /tmp directory is mounted **noexec**, you will
    likely need to modify the TMPDIR so that the bcfg2 client creates
    the temporary files in a directory from which it can execute.

Now we need to figure out what exactly we want to do.  In this case,
we want to hand out an ``/etc/auto.master`` file that looks like::

    /software  /etc/auto.software --timeout 3600
    /home      /etc/auto.home --timeout 3600
    /hometest  /etc/auto.hometest --timeout 3600
    /nfs       /etc/auto.nfs --timeout 3600
    /scratch   /etc/auto.scratch --timeout 3600

for machines that have a scratch disk. For machines without an extra disk,
we want to get rid of that last line::

    /software  /etc/auto.software --timeout 3600
    /home      /etc/auto.home --timeout 3600
    /hometest  /etc/auto.hometest --timeout 3600
    /nfs       /etc/auto.nfs --timeout 3600

So, from the Probes standpoint we want to create a script that counts
the number of SCSI disks in a client machine. To do this, we create a
very simple ``Probes/scratchlocal`` script::

    cat /proc/scsi/scsi | grep Vendor | wc -l

Running this on a node with *n* disks will return the number *n+1*, as
it also counts the controller as a device. To differentiate between the
two classes of machines we care about, we just need to check the output
of this script for numbers greater than 2. We do this in the template.

The ``TCheetah/`` directory is laid out much like the ``Cfg/`` directory.
For this example we will want to create a ``TCheetah/etc/auto.master``
directory to hold the template of the file in question. Inside of this
template we will need to check the result of the Probe script that
got run and act accordingly. The ``TCheetah/etc/auto.master/template``
file looks like::

    /software  /etc/auto.software --timeout 3600
    /home      /etc/auto.home --timeout 3600
    /hometest  /etc/auto.hometest --timeout 3600
    /nfs       /etc/auto.nfs --timeout 3600
    #if int($self.metadata.probes["scratchlocal"]) > 2
    /scratch   /etc/auto.scratch --timeout 3600
    #end if

Any Probe script you run will store its output in
``$self.metadata.Probes["scriptname"]``, so we get to our `scratchlocal`
script's output as seen above.  Note that we had to wrap the output in an
`int()` call; the script output is treated as a string, so it needs to
be converted before it can be tested numerically.

With all of these pieces in place, the following series of events will happen when the client is run:

#. Client runs
#. Server hands down our ``scratchlocal`` probe script
#. Client runs the ``scratchlocal`` probe script and hands its output
   back up to the server
#. Server generates ``/etc/auto.master`` from its template, performing
   any templating substitutions/actions needed in the process.
#. Server hands ``/etc/auto.master`` down to the client
#. Client puts file contents in place.

Now we have a nicely dynamic ``/etc/auto.master`` that can gracefully
handle machines with different numbers of disks. All that's left to do
is to add the ``/etc/auto.master`` to a Bundle:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Path name='/etc/auto.master'/>

Host and Group Specific probes
==============================

Bcfg2 has the ability to alter probes based on client hostname and group
membership. These files work similarly to files in Cfg.

If multiple files with the same basename apply to a client, the most
specific one is used. Only one instance of a probe is served to a given
client, so if a host-specific version and generic version apply, only
the client-specific one will be used.
