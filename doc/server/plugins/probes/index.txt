Probes
======

At times you need to gather information from a client machine before you
can generate its configuration. For example, if some of your machines
have both a local scratch disk and a system disk while others only have
the system disk, you would want to know this information to correctly
generate an `/etc/auto.master` autofs config file for each type. Here
we will look at how to do this.

For the purposes of this example, you will need to set up the TCheetah
plugin, as described on the :ref:`server-plugins-generators-tcheetah`
page.

.. note::

    This does **not** mean that TCheetah is required in order for Probes
    to operate properly.

Next, we need to create a ``Probes`` directory in our toplevel repository
location::

    mkdir /var/lib/bcfg2/Probes

This directory will hold any small scripts we want to use to grab
information from client machines.  These scripts can be in any scripting
language; the shebang line (the ``#!/usr/bin/env some_interpreter_binary``
line at the very top of the script) is used to determine the script's
interpreter.

.. note::

    Bcfg2 uses python mkstemp to create the Probe scripts on the
    client. If your /tmp directory is mounted **noexec**, you will
    likely need to modify the :envvar:`TMPDIR` environment variable so
    that the bcfg2 client creates the temporary files in a directory
    from which it can execute.

Now we need to figure out what exactly we want to do.  In this case,
we want to hand out an ``/etc/auto.master`` file that looks like::

    /software  /etc/auto.software --timeout 3600
    /home      /etc/auto.home --timeout 3600
    /hometest  /etc/auto.hometest --timeout 3600
    /nfs       /etc/auto.nfs --timeout 3600
    /scratch   /etc/auto.scratch --timeout 3600

for machines that have a scratch disk. For machines without an extra disk,
we want to get rid of that last line::

    /software  /etc/auto.software --timeout 3600
    /home      /etc/auto.home --timeout 3600
    /hometest  /etc/auto.hometest --timeout 3600
    /nfs       /etc/auto.nfs --timeout 3600

So, from the Probes standpoint we want to create a script that counts
the number of SCSI disks in a client machine. To do this, we create a
very simple ``Probes/scratchlocal`` script::

    cat /proc/scsi/scsi | grep Vendor | wc -l

Running this on a node with *n* disks will return the number *n+1*, as
it also counts the controller as a device. To differentiate between the
two classes of machines we care about, we just need to check the output
of this script for numbers greater than 2. We do this in the template.

The ``TCheetah/`` directory is laid out much like the ``Cfg/`` directory.
For this example we will want to create a ``TCheetah/etc/auto.master``
directory to hold the template of the file in question. Inside of this
template we will need to check the result of the Probe script that
got run and act accordingly. The ``TCheetah/etc/auto.master/template``
file looks like::

    /software  /etc/auto.software --timeout 3600
    /home      /etc/auto.home --timeout 3600
    /hometest  /etc/auto.hometest --timeout 3600
    /nfs       /etc/auto.nfs --timeout 3600
    #if int($self.metadata.Probes["scratchlocal"]) > 2
    /scratch   /etc/auto.scratch --timeout 3600
    #end if

Any Probe script you run will store its output in
``$self.metadata.Probes["scriptname"]``, so we get to our
`scratchlocal` script's output as seen above.  (See `Handling Probe
Output`_, below, for more information on how this is done.)  Note that
we had to wrap the output in an `int()` call; the script output is
treated as a string, so it needs to be converted before it can be
tested numerically.

With all of these pieces in place, the following series of events will
happen when the client is run:

#. Client runs
#. Server hands down our ``scratchlocal`` probe script
#. Client runs the ``scratchlocal`` probe script and hands its output
   back up to the server
#. Server generates ``/etc/auto.master`` from its template, performing
   any templating substitutions/actions needed in the process.
#. Server hands ``/etc/auto.master`` down to the client
#. Client puts file contents in place.

Now we have a nicely dynamic ``/etc/auto.master`` that can gracefully
handle machines with different numbers of disks. All that's left to do
is to add the ``/etc/auto.master`` to a Bundle:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Path name='/etc/auto.master'/>

Handling Probe Output
=====================

Bcfg2 stores output from probes in the ``Probes`` property of a
client's metadata object.  To access this data in TGenshi, for
instance, you could do::

  ${metadata.Probes['script-name']}

This is not the full output of the probe; any lines that start with
"group:" have been stripped from the output.  The data is a
string-like object that has some interesting and salient features:

* If the data is a valid XML document, then
  ``metadata.Probes['script-name'].xdata`` will be an
  ``lxml.etree._Element`` object representing the XML data.
* If the data is a valid JSON document, and either the Python ``json``
  or ``simplejson`` module is installed, then
  ``metadata.Probes['script-name'].json`` will be a data structure
  representing the JSON data.
* If the data is a valid YAML document, and either the Python ``yaml``
  or ``syck`` module is installed, then
  ``metadata.Probes['script-name'].yaml`` will be a data structure
  representing the YAML data.

If these conditions are not met, then the named properties will be
``None``.  In all other fashions, the probe data objects should act
like strings.

Host- and Group-Specific probes
===============================

Bcfg2 has the ability to alter probes based on client hostname and group
membership. These files work similarly to files in Cfg.

If multiple files with the same basename apply to a client, the most
specific one is used. Only one instance of a probe is served to a given
client, so if a host-specific version and generic version apply, only
the client-specific one will be used.

If you want to to detect information about the client operating system,
the :ref:`server-plugins-probes-ohai` plugin can help.

FileProbes
==========

The FileProbes plugin allows you to probe a client for a file,
which is then added to the :ref:`server-plugins-generators-cfg`
specification.  If the file changes on the client, FileProbes can
either update it in the specification or allow Cfg to replace it.

FileProbes will not probe a file if there's already a file in Cfg that
will apply to the client.  So if, for instance, you have a generic
file in ``Cfg/etc/foo.conf/foo.conf`` that applies to all hosts,
FileProbes will not retrieve ``/etc/foo.conf`` from the client (unless
``update`` is enabled; see Configuration_ below).

When a new config file is first probed, an ``info.xml`` file is also
written to enforce the permissions from that client.  Subsequent
probes from other clients will not modify or overwrite the data in
``info.xml``.  (This ensures that any manual changes you make to
``info.xml`` for that file are not circumvented.)

Configuration
-------------

FileProbes is configured in ``FileProbes/config.xml``, which might
look something like:

.. code-block:: xml

    <FileProbes>
      <FileProbe name="/etc/foo.conf"/>
      <Group name="blah-servers">
        <FileProbe name="/etc/blah.conf" update="true"
      </Group>
      <Client name="bar.example.com">
        <FileProbe name="/var/lib/bar.gz" base64="true"/>
      </Client>
    </FileProbes>

This will result in ``/etc/foo.conf`` being retrieved from all
clients; if it changes on a client, it will be overwritten by the
version that was retrieved initially.

Clients in the ``blah-servers`` group will be probed for
``/etc/blah.conf``; if it changes on a client, those changes will be
written into the Bcfg2 specification.  If the file is deleted from a
client, it will be rewritten from Bcfg2.

``bar.example.com`` will be probed for ``/var/lib/bar.gz``, which
contains non-ASCII characters and so needs to use base64 encoding when
transferring the file.

The paths probed by FileProbes must also be included as Path entries
in your bundles in order to be handled properly by Cfg.  Permissions
are handled as usual, with ``info.xml`` files in Cfg.
