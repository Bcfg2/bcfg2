Why use the Git plugin
======================

The Git plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to your bcfg2
repository using a `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ backend. Currently,
It enables you to get revision information out of your repository for
reporting purposes. Future plans are to commit changes to the repo which
are made by the server.

How to enable the Git plugin
============================

The Git plugin uses `Dulwich <http://samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/>`_ to
interface with git repositories. Therefore, you will need to install
Dulwich on the bcfg2 server first. Once installed, simply add Git to
your plugins line in /etc/bcfg2.conf::

    [server]
    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Git
