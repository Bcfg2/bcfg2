Bcfg2 Dynamic Reporting System
==============================

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

* sqlite3
* pysqlite2
* `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com>`_
* mod-python

Install
-------

Be sure to include the specified fields included the example bcfg2.conf
file. These can be specified in either ``/etc/bcfg2.conf``, if it is readable
by the webserver user, or ``/etc/bcfg2-web.conf``.

Inside the ``bcfg2-tarball/examples/`` directory from the
tarball you will find ``brpt.sqlite``. Copy this file to
``<path-to-bcfg2-repository>/etc/brpt.sqlite``.

If you are not using sqlite (the default choice), please see the
:ref:`alternative-databases` section below.

The recommended statistics plugin is DBStats. To use it, add it to the
``plugins`` line in your bcfg2.conf.

Restart the bcfg2 server. Run a client in dryrun mode in order to get
the client's statistics loaded into the database.

Installation of web-based Reports
---------------------------------

.. note::

    Reports no longer needs to be installed at the root URL for a given
    host. Therefore, reports no longer require their own virtual host.

    In order to make this work, you will need to specify your web prefix
    by adding a **web_prefix** setting in the [statistics] section of
    your ``bcfg2.conf``.

An example site config is included below for the vhost "reports.mcs.anl.gov"::

    <VirtualHost reports.mcs.anl.gov>
            ServerAdmin webmaster@mcs.anl.gov
            ServerName reports.mcs.anl.gov
            DocumentRoot /var/www/reports
            <Directory /var/www/reports>
                    Order deny,allow
                    Deny from all
                    Allow from localhost #you may want to change this
                    AllowOverride None
            </Directory>

            # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
            # alert, emerg.
            LogLevel warn

            ServerSignature Off

            # Stop TRACE/TRACK vulnerability
            <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
                    RewriteEngine on
                    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
                    RewriteRule .* - [F]
            </IfModule>
    <Location "/">
            SetHandler python-program
            PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
            SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE Bcfg2.Server.Reports.settings
            PythonDebug On
    </Location>
    <Location "/site_media/">
            SetHandler None
    </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

The first three lines of this configuration must be customized per site.

The ``bcfg2-tarball/reports/site_media/`` directory needs to be copied
to ``/var/www/reports/site_media/`` It could live anywhere; as long as
the contents are accessible on the virtual host at ``/site_media/``. 

At this point you should be able to point your web browser to the
virtualhost you created and see the new reports

Example WSGI configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

entry.wsgi::

    import os, sys
    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'Bcfg2.Server.Reports.settings'
    import django.core.handlers.wsgi
    application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

Apache conf::

    Alias /bcfg2reports/site_media "/path/to/site_media"
    <Directory /path/to>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>
    # If Python is installed in a non-standard prefix:
    #WSGIPythonHome /python/prefix
    #WSGIPythonPath /python/prefix/lib/python2.6/site-packages
    WSGIScriptAlias /bcfg2reports "/another/path/to/entry.wsgi"

.. _alternative-databases:

Notes on Alternative Databases
------------------------------

If you choose to use a different database, you'll need to edit settings.py
from inside of the brpt module. Instructions on this process can be found
on the Django website. The provided sqlite database file is pre-populated
with the appropriate tables, if you choose a different database engine,
you will need to run "python manage.py syncdb" from the brpt module
directory to configure it before importing any data. As of vers 0.9.5,
these settings are moved to the more appropriate /etc/bcfg2.conf

Summary and Features
====================

The new reporting system was implemented to address a number of
deficiencies in the previous system. By storing statistics data in a
relational database, we are now able to view and analyze more information
about the state of the configuration, including information about previous
configuration. Specific features in the new system include:

* The ability to look at past statistics information.
  [[Image(summary_cal.jpg, 30%, right)]]
* More recent data concerning hosts. The import script may be run quite
  often, updating the database that contains all statistics
  information. In the future we anticipate development of a database
  based statistics module for the server that will allow statistics
  updates to happen immediately as configuration changes happen.
* Additional information display in reports. Primarily, reasons for
  configuration item verification failure are now accessible. This
  additional data is provided only by the most recent client.
* Instead of static pages, pages are generated on the fly, allowing
  users to drill down to find out about a specific host, rather than
  have one huge page with too much information.

Planned improvements include
============================

* Accounts, customized displays for each admin. And privacy of config data.
* Config browsing capabilities; to look at your config in an interesting way.
* Fixing all the known bugs from below. 

Unfortunately with all the improvements, there are a few less exciting
elements about the new reporting system. The new reporting system
moves away from static pages and towards a real web application, which
causes mainly problems with dependancies and makes installation and more
difficult. This should become less of a problem over time as Django is
packaged and we develop a better installation process for a web app. This
should become clear when reading the Installation section that follows.

Usage
=====

You can use these new reports in tandem with the old system. Currently
the new reporting system simply periodically runs an importer script
via cron. This imports the XML statistics and clients files to the
relational database, building historical information. In the future,
a new statistics module in the server will allow direct writing to the
database whenever a configuration interaction occurs, which will make
the reports always up to date.

bcfg2-reports (command line script)
-----------------------------------

bcfg2-reports allows you to retrieve data from the database about clients,
and the states of their current interactions. It also allows you to
change the expired/unexpired states.

The utility runs as a standalone application. It does, however, use the
models from ``/src/lib/Server/Reports/reports/models.py``.

A number of different options can be used to change what bcfg2-reports
displays::

    Usage: python bcfg2-reports [option] ...

    Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
    -a                     : shows all hosts, including expired hosts
    -b NAME                : single-host mode - shows bad entries from the
                             current interaction of NAME
    -c                     : shows only clean hosts
    -d                     : shows only dirty hosts
    -e NAME                : single-host mode - shows extra entries from the
                             current interaction of NAME
    -h                     : shows help and usage info about bcfg2-reports
    -s NAME                : single-host mode - shows bad and extra entries from
                             the current interaction of NAME
    -x NAME                : toggles expired/unexpired state of NAME
    --badentry=KIND,NAME   : shows only hosts whose current interaction has bad
                             entries in of KIND kind and NAME name; if a single
                             argument ARG1 is given, then KIND,NAME pairs will be
                             read from a file of name ARG1
    --extraentry=KIND,NAME : shows only hosts whose current interaction has extra
                             entries in of KIND kind and NAME name; if a single
                             argument ARG1 is given, then KIND,NAME pairs will be
                             read from a file of name ARG1
    --fields=ARG1,ARG2,... : only displays the fields ARG1,ARG2,...
                             (name,time,state)
    --sort=ARG1,ARG2,...   : sorts output on ARG1,ARG2,... (name,time,state)
    --stale                : shows hosts which haven't run in the last 24 hours
