Bcfg2 Static Reporting System
=============================

The Bcfg2 reporting system collects and displays information about the 
operation of the Bcfg2 client, and the configuration states of target machines.

Goals
=====

The reporting system provides an interface to administrators describing a few important tasks

* Client configuration state, particularly aspects that do not match the configuration specification.
  Information about bad and extra configuration elements is included.
* Client execution results (a list of configuration elements that were modified)
* Client execution performance data (including operation retry counts, and timings for several critical execution regions)

This data can be used to understand the current configuration state of the 
entire network, the operations performed by the client, how the configuration changes propagate, and 
any reconfiguration operations that have failed.

Retention Model
===============

The current reporting system stores statistics in an XML data store, by default to {{{<repo>/etc/statistics.xml}}}. It retains either 
one or two statistic sets per host. If the client has a clean configuration state, the most recent (clean) record is retained. 
If the client has a dirty configuration state, two records are retained. One record is the last 
clean record. The other record is the most recent record collected, detailing the incorrect state.  

This retention model, while non-optimal, does manage to persistently record most of the data that users would like. 

Setup
=====

In order to configure your bcfg2 server for receiving reports, you will need to list the Statistics plugin in the plugins line of your bcfg2.conf (starting in 1.0). You will also need a [statistics] section in your bcfg2.conf. You can find out more about what goes there in the bcfg2.conf manpage.

Output
======

Several output reports can be generated from the statistics store with the command line tool {{{bcfg2-build-reports}}}.

* Nodes Digest
* Nodes Individual
* Overview Statistics
* Performance

The data generated by these reports can be delivered by several mechanisms:

* HTML
* Email
* RSS

Shortcomings and Planned Enhancements
=====================================

When designing the current reporting system, we were overly concerned with the potential explosion in data size over time.
In order to address this, we opted to use the retention scheme described above. This approach has several shortcomings:

* A comprehensive list of reconfiguration operations (with associated timestamps) isn't retained
* Client results for any given day (except the last one) aren't uniformly retained. This means that inter-client analysis is 
  difficult, if not impossible

We plan to move to a database backend to address the dataset size problem and start retaining all information. The move to a 
SQL backend will allow many more types of queries to be efficiently processed. It will also make on-demand reports simpler. 

Other sorts of information would also be useful to track. We plan to add the ability to tag a particular configuration 
element as security related, and include this in reports. This will aid in the effective prioritization of manual and 
failed reconfiguration tasks. 

Capability Goals (posed as questions)
-------------------------------------

* What machines have not yet applied critical updates?
* How long did critical updates take to be applied?
* What configuration did machine X have on a particular date?
* When did machine X perform configuration update Y?
