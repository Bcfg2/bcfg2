.UNINDENT
.SH SERVER PLUGINS
.sp
This section has a listing of all the plugins currently provided with
Bcfg2.
.SS ACL Plugin
.sp
The ACL plugin controls which hosts can make which XML\-RPC calls.
.SS Bundler Plugin
.sp
The Bundler plugin is used to describe groups of inter\-dependent
configuration entries, such as the combination of packages, configuration
files, and service activations that comprise typical Unix daemons. Bundles
are used to add groups of configuration entries to the inventory of
client configurations, as opposed to describing particular versions of
those entries.
.SS Bzr Plugin
.sp
The Bzr plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository
using a GNU Bazaar version control backend. Currently, it enables you to
get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes.
.SS Cfg Plugin
.sp
The Cfg plugin provides a repository to describe configuration file
contents for clients. In its simplest form, the Cfg repository is just a
directory tree modeled off of the directory tree on your client
machines.
.SS Cvs Plugin
.sp
The Cvs plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository
using a Concurrent version control backend. Currently, it enables you to
get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes.
.SS Darcs Plugin
.sp
The Darcs plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository
using a Darcs version control backend. Currently, it enables you to get
revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes.
.SS Decisions Plugin
.sp
The Decisions plugin has support for a centralized set of per\-entry
installation decisions. This approach is needed when particular changes
are deemed "\fIhigh risk\fP"; this gives the ability to centrally specify
these changes, but only install them on clients when administrator
supervision is available.
.SS Defaults Plugin
.sp
The Defaults plugin can be used to populate default attributes for
entries. Defaults is \fInot\fP a Generator plugin, so it does not actually
bind an entry; Defaults are applied after an entry has been bound,
and only populate attributes that are not yet set.
.SS Deps Plugin
.sp
The Deps plugin allows you to make a series of assertions like "Package
X requires Package Y (and optionally also Package Z etc.)"
.SS FileProbes Plugin
.sp
The FileProbes plugin allows you to probe a client for a file, which is
then added to the Cfg specification. If the file changes on the client,
FileProbes can either update it in the specification or allow Cfg to
replace it.
.SS Fossil Plugin
.sp
The Fossil plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository
using a Fossil SCM version control backend. Currently, it enables you to
get revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes.
.SS Git Plugin
.sp
The Git plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository
using a Git version control backend. Currently, it enables you to get
revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes.
.SS GroupLogic Plugin
.sp
The GroupLogic plugin lets you flexibly assign group membership with a
Genshi template.
.SS GroupPatterns Plugin
.sp
The GroupPatterns plugin is a connector that can assign clients group
membership based on patterns in client hostnames.
.SS Guppy Plugin
.sp
The Guppy plugin is used to trace memory leaks within the bcfg2\-server
process using Guppy.
.SS Hg Plugin
.sp
The Hg plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository using
a Mercurial version control backend. Currently, it enables you to get
revision information out of your repository for reporting purposes.
.SS Ldap Plugin
.sp
The Ldap plugin makes it possible to fetch data from an LDAP directory,
process it and attach it to your metadata.
.SS Metadata Plugin
.sp
The Metadata plugin is the primary method of specifying Bcfg2 server
metadata.
.SS NagiosGen Plugin
.sp
The NagiosGen plugin dynamically generates Nagios configuration files
based on Bcfg2 data.
.SS Ohai Plugin
.sp
The Ohai plugin is used to detect information about the client operating
system. The data is reported back to the server using JSON.
.SS Packages Plugin
.sp
The Packages plugin is an alternative to Pkgmgr for specifying package
entries for clients. Where Pkgmgr explicitly specifies package entry
information, Packages delegates control of package version information
to the underlying package manager, installing the latest version
available from through those channels.
.SS Pkgmgr Plugin
.sp
The Pkgmgr plugin resolves the Abstract Configuration Entity "Package"
to a package specification that the client can use to detect, verify and
install the specified package.
.SS POSIXCompat Plugin
.sp
The POSIXCompat plugin provides a compatibility layer for 1.3 POSIX
Entries so that they are compatible with older clients.
.SS Probes Plugin
.sp
The Probes plugin gives you the ability to gather information from a
client machine before you generate its configuration. This information
can be used with the various templating systems to generate
configuration based on the results.
.SS Properties Plugin
.sp
The Properties plugin is a connector plugin that adds information from
properties files into client metadata instances.
.SS PuppetENC Plugin
.sp
The PuppetENC plugin is a connector plugin that adds support for Puppet
External Node Classifiers.
.SS Reporting Plugin
.sp
The Reporting plugin enables the collection of data for use with Bcfg2\(aqs
dynamic reporting system.
.SS Rules Plugin
.sp
The Rules plugin provides literal configuration entries that resolve
the abstract configuration entries normally found in Bundler. The
literal entries in Rules are suitable for consumption by the
appropriate client drivers.
.SS SEModules Plugin
.sp
The SEModules plugin provides a way to distribute SELinux modules via
Bcfg2.
.SS ServiceCompat Plugin
.sp
The ServiceCompat plugin converts service entries for older clients.
.SS SSHbase Plugin
.sp
The SSHbase generator plugin manages ssh host keys (both v1 and v2) for
hosts. It also manages the ssh_known_hosts file. It can integrate host
keys from other management domains and similarly export its keys.
.SS Svn Plugin
.sp
The Svn plugin allows you to track changes to your Bcfg2 repository
using a Subversion backend. Currently, it enables you to get revision
information out of your repository for reporting purposes.
.SS Trigger Plugin
.sp
The Trigger plugin provides a method for calling external scripts when
clients are configured.

metadata objects are created only from the data in the
Metadata plugin, before additional groups from other plugins
are merged in.
.IP \(bu 2
cautious: Final metadata objects are cached, but each client’s
cache is cleared at the start of each client run, immediately
after probe data is received. Cache is also cleared as in
aggressive mode. \fIon\fP is a synonym for cautious.

responsible for clearing cache when appropriate.
