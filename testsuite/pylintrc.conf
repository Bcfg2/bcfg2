# Some of these are disabled because they warn about things we _want_:
#
# * W0142: Used * or ** magic
# * W1201: Specify string format arguments as logging function parameters
# * I0011: Locally disabling a pylint message
# * R0921: Abstract class not referenced
# * R0922: Abstract class is only referenced a small number of times
#
# We have several modules, e.g., Bcfg2.Server.Plugin.interfaces, that
# only declare abstract classes, which makes R0921 and R0922 useless.

# Some of these are disabled because they just aren't that useful:
#
# * R0901: Too many ancestors
# * R0902: Too many instance attributes
# * R0903: Too few public methods
# * R0904: Too many public methods

# Some of these are disabled because they cause lots of errors with no
# obvious solutions, but we should try to enable them at some point in
# the future:
#
# * W0511: FIXME or TODO
# * W0603: Using the global statement
# * R0201: Method could be a function
# * R0801: Similar lines in files
# * C0302: Too many lines in module

# Some of these are disabled because of bugs in pylint:
# * E0100,E0101,E0102,E0106: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12514214/pylint-and-tornado-fails-on-tornado-web-authenticated

# Some of these are disabled for various other reasons:

# * F0401: Unable to import a module: Bcfg2 has loads and loads of
